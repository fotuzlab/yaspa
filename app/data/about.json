      "content": "<p>Yaspa is a <strong>Single Page Application</strong> (SPA).</p><p>An SPA is a web application that works inside a single page. What this entails is that all the different pages that you see here are not separate html files that refresh the entire screen everytime you click on a link; instead, these are all embedded into a single page and only the content that needs to update updates.</p><p>The obvious benefits are that there is less data sent and recieved and thus this approach proves lighter & faster than a conventional website. The redrawing of every page is also delegated to the client side which has the obvious effect of more bandwidth available on the server.</p><p>Though this is just a prototype/proof-of-concept that is primarily developed to demonstrate the use of technology that is needed for such apps, this application can also be readily used with some editions to serve real industrial purposes.</p><p><em>Check out the other sections on this page to know more about Yaspa!</em></p>"

      "title": "How does it work?",
      "content": "<p>Yaspa is achieved after integrating several pieces of technology into it's stack. Most if it is popular libraries you might've heard about recently if you're interested in web development (Spoiler: Yaspa uses Javascript end-to-end, from the server to the client and everything in between!). The following is a non-comprehensive list of the stuff we put together and worked on making it all work in perfect harmony for Yaspa.</p><ul><li><h4>AngularJS</h4><p>HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop. AngularJS being the crux of Yaspa, we've used it extensibly for all possible situations we could think of, just for the heck of it!</p></li><li><h4>Node.js</h4><p>Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices. Node.js has server marvellously as the serving base for this app. </p></li><li><h4>MongoDB</h4><p>We needed a database to communicate between the node.js powered server and the angular powered client and MongoDB was the obvious choice! MongoDB (from \"humongous\") is a scalable, high-performance, open source NoSQL database. And did I forget it's awesome?</p></li><li><h4>Express</h4><p>Being a web application framework for Node.js, Express served as the perfect framework that glued all the pieces together and served us a nice platform to build on. </p></li><li><h4>Twitter Bootstrap + Sass + Compass</h4><p>Short for Sassy CSS, we used Sass to write beautiful, nested, easily debuggable styling for Yaspa, and coupled with Compass and Twitter Bootstrap, Yaspa is eye-catching, editable & the stuff of legends! Plus, it works on all browsers, even for as prehistoric as IE8 ! (Sorry IE6, we don't miss you :D)</p></li>"
